1. Single Inheritance

Parent -> Child

*enables a derived class to inherit characteristics from a single-parent class*

2. Multilevel Inheritance

GrandParent -> Parent -> Child

*enables a derived class to inherit properties from an immediate parent class which in turn inherits properties from his parent class*

3. Hierarchial Inheritance

Parent -> Child1, Child2

*enables more than one derived class to inherit properties from a parent class*


4. Multiple Inheritance

Parent1, Parent2 ->Child1

*enables one derived class to inherit properties from more than one base class*


## Polymorphism
having many forms

## Encapsulation
the variables (private) can only be changed by the method in which they are declared

wraps the data and the methods that work on data within one unit and we cannot change it from outside the method

## Data Abstraction 
It hides unnecessary code details from the user.
